        <h2>Developing Ethically Owned and Operated Restorative Economic Organizations</h2>
        
<p>The Zinc Technology Network (ZTN) is composed of restorative socioeconomic organizations.
  We develops these organizations through free access to whatever information, support, and low-cost capital we can make
  safely available.
</p>

<section id="philosophy">
  <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
  <h3>Just Power Is Derived From The Consent Of The Governed</h3>
  <p>
    Restorative organizations bind investors, customers, and workers together in a mutually beneficial manner.
    They ensure each person within the system has representation that establishes the norms, agreements, and rules the
    organization operates under.
    And they make it safe to join, stay or go without fear or loss.
  </p>

  <h3>Put On Our Mask</h3>
  <p>We care for ourselves, because if we do not care for ourselves; we cannot care for others.
    We care for others so that they may, in time, care for themselves.
    Because when we support people so that they can care for themselves, they care for others in turn.
  </p>

  <h3>Remove The Knife</h3>
  <p>We stand on the shoulders of giants, and also on the backs and necks of those whose consent was not sought in our
    current socioeconomic context.

    To rectify this, we prioritize the needs of those who endured and persisted despite multi-generational socioeconomic
    exploitation.
  </p>

  <h3>Take Small, Safe Steps; Together</h3>
  <p>Restorative organizations seek to go far, not fast.
    We understand that "to go fast, go alone; to go far, go together."
    To go together we slow down to match the pace of those who we would leave behind.
    We take pauses to breathe, step back, and follow others lead.</p>

  <h3>Don't Stop Until All Are Free</h3>

<section id="history">
  <h2>The History</h2>
  <p>ZTN was founded in 2015 by <a href="https://www.zeespencer.com">Zee Spencer</a>. He'd ran his own microconsultancy
    back in the midwest, and wanted to try it out in the the San Francisco Bay Area Market. In six months, ZTN grew to 5
    part-time contractors across 3 clients. What could go wrong? Zee was in over his head. Consultancies don't scale
    linearly. Things fell apart. He helped his team find new gigs and let everyone go.</p>
  <p>He spent the next two years working in FinTech, burning out hardÂ so Jamie Dimon can afford a slightly larger yach.
    In 2017, a bit tired of the madhouse that is venture backed, 10x growth-mandated companies Zee rebooted ZTN. But
    this time, he had help. He brought on <a href="https://twitter.com/jtu">Jennifer Tu</a> and <a
      href="https://twitter.com/betsythemuffin/">Betsy Haibel</a>, with the goal of operating as a worker-cooperative.
    Together, they launched <a href="https://www.wecohere.com/">Cohere</a>. To this day, Cohere provides Zee and
    Jennifer with a sustainable living, while Betsy provides senior engineering leadership at the <a
      href="https://ltse.com/">Long Term Stock Exchange.</a>
  </p>
  <p>Zee began researching other mechanisms for creating a healthy, sustainable, restorative way to work; and found two
    communities that showed better way: the <a href="https://www.theselc.org/">Sustainable Economies Law Center</a> and
    <a href="https://www.zebrasunite.com/">Zebras Unite</a>. </p>
  <p>Enamored with the <a href="https://ebprec.org/">East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative</a>, Zee found a use for
    ZTN again. He took 15% of his assets and said "Fuck it, let's light this shit on fire." He brought on <a
      href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/viveknarayan5/">Vivek Narayan</a>, a former client of ZTN. Together, they
    acquired a small portfolio of software products that would never achieve results that would make their investors
    happy. With real products used by real customers, they lured together a team of professional designers, support team
    members, and engineers to steward them. They formed a worker-self directed technology product and service company:
    <a href="https://www.zinc.coop/">ZINC</a>. (Note: ZINC does <em>not</em> stand for "Zee Is eNtranced by Coops.")
  </p>
  <p>But there is still more to do. The knife must be removed. None are free until all are free.</p>
  <p>In 2020, ZTN began lending small cash amounts at low interest rates to members of under-capitalized communities so
    they can self-determine their own best way forward. Starting a non-profit? Go for it! Taking the coop route? Great!
    Think you can dance with the angels and swim with the sharks? We ain't gonna stop ya. </p>
  <p>We'll see how it goes.</p>
