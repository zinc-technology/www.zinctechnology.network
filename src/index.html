<title>Investing In Ethically Owned and Operated Restorative Economic Systems</title>

<body>
  <h1>It Doesn't Have To Suck</h1>
  <p>The Zinc Technology Network (ZTN) funds restorative economic organizations by providing low-cost-of-capital
    investments to organizations led by members of under-capitalized communities.</p>
  <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
  <p><strong>Removing The Knife Is Step 1</strong></p>
  <p><strong>None Are Free Until All Are Free</strong></p>
  <p><strong>We Are The Market</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Cooperation Is A Competitive Advantage</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Workers first, Consumers second, Investors last.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>To Go Fast, Go Alone. To Go Far, Go Together</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Many Small Steps Beat Large Ones</strong></p>

  <h2>The History</h2>
  <p>ZTN was founded in 2015 by <a href="https://www.zeespencer.com">Zee Spencer</a>. He'd ran his own microconsultancy
    back in the midwest, and wanted to try it out in the the San Francisco Bay Area Market. In six months, ZTN grew to 5
    part-time contractors across 3 clients. What could go wrong? Zee was in over his head. Consultancies don't scale
    linearly. Things fell apart. He helped his team find new gigs and let everyone go.</p>
  <p>He spent the next two years working in FinTech, burning out hardÂ so Jamie Dimon can afford a slightly larger yach.
    In 2017, a bit tired of the madhouse that is venture backed, 10x growth-mandated companies Zee rebooted ZTN. But
    this time, he had help. He brought on <a href="https://twitter.com/jtu">Jennifer Tu</a> and <a
      href="https://twitter.com/betsythemuffin/">Betsy Haibel</a>, with the goal of operating as a worker-cooperative.
    Together, they launched <a href="https://www.wecohere.com/">Cohere</a>. To this day, Cohere provides Zee and
    Jennifer with a sustainable living, while Betsy provides senior engineering leadership at the <a
      href="https://ltse.com/">Long Term Stock Exchange.</a>
  </p>
  <p>Zee began researching other mechanisms for creating a healthy, sustainable, restorative way to work; and found two
    communities that showed better way: the <a href="https://www.theselc.org/">Sustainable Economies Law Center</a> and
    <a href="https://www.zebrasunite.com/">Zebras Unite</a>. </p>
  <p>Enamored with the <a href="https://ebprec.org/">East Bay Permanent Real Estate Cooperative</a>, Zee found a use for
    ZTN again. He took 15% of his assets and said "Fuck it, let's light this shit on fire." He brought on <a
      href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/viveknarayan5/">Vivek Narayan</a>, a former client of ZTN. Together, they
    acquired a small portfolio of software products that would never achieve results that would make their investors
    happy. With real products used by real customers, they lured together a team of professional designers, support team
    members, and engineers to steward them. They formed a worker-self directed technology product and service company:
    <a href="https://www.zinc.coop/">ZINC</a>. (Note: ZINC does <em>not</em> stand for "Zee Is eNtranced by Coops.")
  </p>
  <p>But there is still more to do. The knife must be removed. None are free until all are free.</p>
  <p>In 2020, ZTN began lending small cash amounts at low interest rates to members of under-capitalized communities so
    they can self-determine their own best way forward. Starting a non-profit? Go for it! Taking the coop route? Great!
    Think you can dance with the angels and swim with the sharks? We ain't gonna stop ya. </p>
  <p>We'll see how it goes.</p>
